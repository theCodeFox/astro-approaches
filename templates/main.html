        <h2>Asteroid Info</h2>
        <p>
            The majority of the known asteroids in the Solar System orbit the Sun in a band between Mars and Jupiter. This band is commonly referred to as the Asteroid Belt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although there are hundreds of thousands of asteroids in the Asteroid Belt, there are only around 200 that exceed 100 km in diameter, making the majority of the asteroids realtively small objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Current theories suggest that the asteroids found in the Asoteroid Belt are the remnants of a planet that failed to form during the development of our Solar System. More specifically, it is believed that when Jupiter formed, its huge mass and gravitational pull disrupted the material in the Asteroid Belt to accrete, or join together, to form into a planet. If all the material in the Asteroid Belt were to be combined, the resulting object’s diameter would be about half that of Earth’s moon.
